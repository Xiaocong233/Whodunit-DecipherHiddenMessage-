# Whodunit-DecipherHiddenMessage-
Program wrote for cs50x pset3, with the framework of files dealing codes given to me.
It functions by helping the detective to visualize the hidden message of the fictional victim's secret message about the criminal in file "clue.bmp" by reducing the red noises appeared on the original bmp file, essentially, changing any pixels with red value greater than 0xf5 to plain white (0x0). Outputting the cleaned-up new file "Verdict (1).bmp".
